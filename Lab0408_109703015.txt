Love Yourself

Written by Holly Lou,Composed by Holly Lou

When your memories aren’t the same as you remembered
Ice cream doesn’t taste the same when it tastes like your tears
When you don’t have room in your heart for anybody else
Do you still have courage to face your greatest fears
So can you love yourself, love yourself?
Ain’t nobody in this world gonna love you, if you don’t love yourself
Save yourself, save yourself
Ain’t nobody gonna save you, if you don’t save yourself

When after all this time you start to realize
Mistakes you trip over won’t turn into second chances
We all go out of our way to avoid the unknown
But there’s one thing you should do under all circumstances
Love yourself, love yourself
Ain’t nobody in this world gonna love you, if you don’t love yourself
Save yourself, save yourself
Ain’t nobody gonna save you, if you don’t save yourself
Ain’t nobody gonna save you, if you don’t save yourself

Love yourself, love yourself
When you love yourself that’s when you discover someone loves you, too
